          <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
          <p>To live fully and happy, it is important to work on spirit and mind. I believe in 
            law of attraction and consistently work on my spiritual growth. I have attended many 
            seminars and workshops, and I am an active volunteer at events of Tony Robbins who is a famous
            motivational speaker and coach.</p>
          <p>Here is the picture from the last live event called Date With Destiny. It was held
            in West Palm Beach, FL in December 2019. Tony Robbins and his wife are in the middle, and
            all other people in the picture including myself are volunteers.</p>

          <h2>Travel</h2>
          <p>I love to visit new places. Also, I have learned that traveling expands our mind and 
            forces for critical thinking because of new unfamiliar environment. One of my favorite 
            places is Crested Butte, Colorado. This small town is known for summer mount biking and scenic
            meadows full of unique wildflowers. Crested Butte has the title of "Wildflower Capital of Colorado".</p>

          <h2>Downhill Skiing</h2>
          <p>I love snow and the magic of winter fairy tale. Downhill skiing is the hobby that lets me 
            challenge myself and push the limits. I have visited several ski resorts in the USA, and my
            favorite is Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p>
          <p>In the picture, there is my husband and I at the highest point of Jackson Hole.</p>

          <h2>Corbet's Couloir</h2>
          <p>Jackson Hole is a popular ski destination among professional skiers. It is world-famous for 
            the legendary Corbet's Couloir, an expert ski run. Please, watch a breathtaking video
            of people dropping off the cliff.</p>
