          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
          <p>My name is Yulia Moiseyenko, and this is my first year at IIT. I have transferred from
            the College of DuPage, where I studied business, and is considered to be a third-year student.
            I picked ITM as my major. Also, I am planning to minor in Business.
            I am new to the information technology field, but I liked it after the first semester.
            I strongly believe that progress equals happiness; so, I love to learn new things.
            Besides school, I am a day trader focusing on options and futures.</p>
          <p>Originally, I am from Belarus and moved to the United States nine years ago.
            I speak three languages: English, Russian, and Belarusian.</p>

          <h3>Best Book</h3>
          <p>My favorite book is <em>"The Power Of Now"</em> by Eckhart Tolle.
            The book is about becoming enlightened and finding peace and joy by
            tapping into your consciousness and by living in the moment.</p>
          <p>The core message in the book is that our conditioned mind, conventional
            thinking pattern and sense of self prevents us from seeing the world and
            ourselves unfiltered. All true relationships are blocked by our beliefs
            created by incessant mental noise that have no objective reality.
            Once we learn the art of freeing ourselves from our
            thoughts, observing our thoughts, good and bad without judgment and
            being fully present in the moment will we be able to tap into our consciousness
            which with constant practise will lead to enlightenment.</p>
